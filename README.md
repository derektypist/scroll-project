# Scroll Project

The purpose of the project is to provide the scroll project using plain JavaScript, without using any frameworks.  However, Google Fonts and Font Awesome will be used.

## UX

As a user, when I hover over the links, I expect the color to change.

As a user, when I click on a link, I expect to go to the correct section.

As a user, when I use a smaller screen, I am able to show or hide the navigation bar.

As a user, I expect to move to the top if the up arrow is present.

## Features

Hiding and Showing Navigation on Smaller Screens.  The ability to move to the top.

## Technologies

Uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Font Awesome 5.15.3 and Google Fonts.

## Testing

Ensure that all the user stories have been met.

## Deployment
